B's and C's of the Hanoi Coding Dojo 24

Goal : Trying to port an old smalltalk gui application to a new version of the language by using the mikado method and tests for solving bugs

* B's
** approach to smalltalk and its syntax
** seeing the process of interactive debugging
** workflow of mikado
** great example for seeing the system concept of smalltalk ide with its own git or image sytem

* C's
** not very clear how to apply mikado method -> you want more practical example (simple one and very know)
** ide difficult to learn for this exercise
** limitation of the sandboxing system and integration of the tools which can collapse the whole system
** maybe too much at the same time (language, mikado, basecode)
** mistake of using moose -> maybe basic pharo image
