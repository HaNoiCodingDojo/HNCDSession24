#B's and C's of the Hanoi Coding Dojo 24

Goal: Trying to port a Smalltalk game application called [Magic Worlds](http://code.google.com/p/magic-words/) from Squeak 4.2 to Moose 4.6 (based on Pharo 1.3) by using the mikado method and tests for solving bugs.

##B's
- approach to smalltalk and its syntax
- seeing the process of interactive debugging
- workflow of mikado
- great example for seeing the system concept of smalltalk ide with its own git or image sytem

##C's
- not very clear how to apply mikado method -> you want more practical example (simple one and very know)
- ide difficult to learn for this exercise
- limitation of the sandboxing system and integration of the tools which can collapse the whole system
- maybe too much at the same time (language, mikado, basecode)
- mistake of using moose -> maybe basic pharo image (that included refactoring browser)
